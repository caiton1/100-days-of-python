# Stock news project
This is just a small project practicing using API calls and slicing up the data into usable parts using python

## Note:
Because this project uses API keys that are specific to me, I do not want to distribute these into the public. To run the program you are going to have to set these environment variables:

| Variable      | Description           |
| ------------- |:---------------------:|
| ALPVANKEY     | API key to https://www.alphavantage.co/ |
| NEWSKEY      | API key to https://newsapi.org/    |
| TWILIO_ACC | Account number in https://twilio.com     |
| TWILIO_TOKEN | Token from https://twilio.com |
| MY_CELL | Phone number to sent alers to    |
